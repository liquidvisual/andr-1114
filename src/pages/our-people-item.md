### About Felix

---

Felix is the Partner in charge of our Commercial Litigation Department. He works primarily in the Adelaide office, but visits our regional and suburban offices by appointment.

Prior to commencing his career in law, Felix worked in the Information Technology sector for a major South Australian computer supplier. He maintains his interest in IT by studying the application of law to developments within technology driven markets such as e-commerce, online security and contracts.

Felix recognises that the modern practice of the law is ultimately a service industry and his approach to litigious matters is resolution driven and cost effective. Given that the majority of Felix's clients are already involved in litigation or facing litigation, he considers it important that we deliver prompt results at a reasonable cost.

Felix represents clients in all jurisdictions on commercial matters in South Australia's various Courts, Tribunals and regulatory organisations. Amongst the matters most frequently handled are:

- Retail and commercial lease disputes in the Magistrates and District Courts
- Land possession applications and caveat enforcements in the Supreme Court
- Bankruptcy proceedings
- Disputed Wills and inheritance claims in the Supreme Court

In his spare time, Felix enjoys travelling overseas, exploring South Australia and its history, live music and meeting new people.

Felix speaks German.
